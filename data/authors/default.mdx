# Hi, I'm Adão 👋
📍 Portugal | CTO at [Powerdot](https://powerdot.com)

15+ years designing distributed systems, scaling platforms, and leading engineering teams.
Currently building the technology foundation for large-scale EV charging infrastructure across Europe.

### Philosophy
> Build systems that scale before the business forces you to. Good architecture is a competitive advantage, not a cost centre.

## What I'm Working On

  points across Europe. Owning OCPP and OCPI platforms covering interoperability, tariffs,
  roaming, and security.

  approaches, and OCPP Gateway open source efforts.
- **Industry community** - Publishing whitepapers and participating in CPO standards and
  innovation forums.

## Focus Areas
- OCPP and OCPI platform architecture for interoperability, tariffs, roaming, and security
- Scalable backend systems for real-time session management, pricing, and settlement
- Uptime SLOs, observability standards, and incident response practices
- Asset telemetry, maintenance systems, and field performance at scale
- Technical strategy aligned to growth and unit economics

### Background
- 15+ years as a builder, software architect, engineering manager, and technology leader
- Advisor to early-stage teams on product strategy, architecture, and technical due diligence
- Founded YMedia, a web agency and automaded online ads service, failed hard in 2018
