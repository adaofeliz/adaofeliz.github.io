Every blog needs a first post. So here we are.

## Who I am

I'm a senior technology leader — currently CTO at Powerdot — with a long career spent building software, leading engineering teams, and trying to stay genuinely curious about how things work. Outside of work, I spend time on my homelab, on my mountain bike, and increasingly in the gym. I read a lot, tinker often, and occasionally have opinions worth writing down.

## What this blog is

This is my personal publishing space. No CMS, no editorial process — just an MDX file, a git push, and whatever I happen to be thinking about. The topics will follow my actual life: technology, fitness, homelab projects, things I've learned, things I've broken, and the occasional reflection on what it's like to do this job at this stage of a career.

## What this blog is not

It is not a corporate communications channel. The views here are my own. Nothing I write represents the position of Powerdot or anyone I work with. That disclaimer is in the footer of every page, and I mean it.

## Why now

I've had drafts sitting in plain Markdown for longer than I care to admit. Building a proper home for them felt like the right first step. The pipeline is working, the domain is live, and there is no longer a good reason to keep writing into a void.

So: hello world. Let's see where this goes...
