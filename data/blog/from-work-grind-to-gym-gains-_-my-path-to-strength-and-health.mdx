I spent fifteen years treating my body like a vehicle. It got me from home to the desk and back. That was its job. I never questioned whether it was up for anything more.

I started as a software engineer, founded a few companies, and at one point worked on Pacific time from Europe. My days began at 6 p.m. and ended at 3 or 4 a.m. Exercise was not even on the list. Nutrition meant eating whatever was available, whenever I remembered. I built my career on discipline and long hours, but I applied none of that discipline to myself.

## The photo that changed everything

When I joined Powerdot, I felt on top of the world. I gave a presentation to the entire company about technology strategy, and the room was engaged, the energy was real. People took photos. During the talk, I was already thinking about which picture I would post on LinkedIn to share how proud and excited I was.

Then I saw the photos.

I looked at myself and thought: who is this guy? I did not recognize the person in those images. The gap between how I felt inside, proud, sharp, full of energy, and how I looked on the outside was impossible to ignore. I felt ashamed. That was the moment I knew something had to change.

## Starting from zero

I did what most people do first. I started eating less. Then I started reading about nutrition, calories, deficits, macros. I realized I needed professional help, not guesswork. In September 2024, I met my nutritionist. He is a sports nutritionist and a competitive powerlifter himself. He helped me build a real plan with clear goals and better food choices. And then he said something I was not expecting: you need to go to a gym. That scared me. I am a father of two. My wife works in tech. Our schedules are packed from early morning to late at night. Finding time felt impossible.

## The system that made it possible

None of this works without my wife. She is a Lead Product Manager in technology, running her own demanding schedule every day. We both operate at full capacity from early morning to late at night. So when I told her I wanted to change, she did not just say "go for it." She sat down with me and we planned this together. We treated it like any project. We looked at our nutrition and agreed on what had to change. Less sugar, less oil, more vegetables, more fruit, more water. We redesigned how we eat as a family. Not one of us leading and the other following. Both of us deciding what stays and what goes. Then we tackled the schedule. Two careers in tech, two kids, zero free time. We split the week. I train Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. She trains Tuesdays and Thursdays. Whoever is not at the gym handles the morning routine at home. 

She did not just make space for me. She jumped into the journey herself, on her own days, with her own goals. We are on the same path, running it in parallel.

We found a gym that we both liked. Their methodology was exactly what we needed. A personal trainer in every session. A plan designed for each of us. Progression structured in phases: technique first, then repetitions, then strength, then resistance, then back to strength again. They measured body fat, ran bioimpedance tests, and took every piece of planning off our plates. All we had to do was show up and execute.

## The dirst sparks

In the beginning, everything was hard. I could not run more than 800 meters. I could not stay on a bike for five minutes. I had no technique for a back squat or a bench press. I felt clumsy and out of place. But after a few weeks, I noticed small improvements. I could run a bit farther. I did not feel as tired. Those small sparks of progress kept me going. After a few months, the pieces connected. I went from not being able to run to signing up for a 10-kilometer race. I started at 96 kilograms. Eight months later, I hit 75 kilograms, my lowest weight ever. I started to see muscles. My body started to take shape.

And something I never expected happened. My headaches disappeared.

Since I was young, I always had headaches. I took ibuprofen regularly and treated it as normal, like background noise that never stopped. After months of training, better nutrition, and drinking more water, they were gone. I still do not know which specific change made the difference. Probably all of them together. But I went from constant headaches to none.

## More than exercise

This process became much more than training or losing weight. It changed how I live. I started reading about longevity, VO2 max, supplements, and how strength training and nutrition affect the probability of serious disease. I started sleeping better. I built a routine and learned that when motivation fades, discipline and cadence carry you forward. Nothing beats showing up every day.

The fitness community surprised me more than anything. I have never been around people so supportive, so humble, so willing to help someone who is just starting. The personal trainers at One More shared their own stories, corrected my form without making me feel small, and showed me what real humility looks like, even when they were far stronger and more experienced than me.

## Better professional, better person

Training rewired how I see people. I started valuing those who bring energy, who support your growth, who stay with you when things are hard. I started moving away from people who drain you and give nothing back. I could not have done any of this without my wife, who was all in from day one. Without the nutritionist who pushed me toward the gym. Without the trainers who treated a complete beginner with patience and respect. This made me a better professional and a better leader. The discipline, the resilience, the ability to push through on hard days, all of it transfers directly to how I lead a team. I learned to talk to myself with strength and courage, to not back down when things get difficult. Fitness taught me that the people with the best results should be the ones supporting those who are just starting or struggling the most.

## Just Start

If you are sitting where I was, work-focused, body on autopilot, feeling like your physical self is just along for the ride, I have one thing to say. Go to the gym. Find someone who will guide you. Just start. In eighteen months, I went from looking at a photo and not recognizing myself to someone who sleeps better, thinks with more clarity, leads with more patience, and feels proud of what he sees. You do not need a perfect plan. You need day one.

Invest in yourself. Take care of yourself. Protect yourself. The life you get back is worth every awkward, clumsy, uncomfortable rep. What was your day one moment? I would genuinely like to hear what made you start, or what is still holding you back.
