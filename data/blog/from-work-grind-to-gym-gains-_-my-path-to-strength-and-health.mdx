I spent all my life treating my body like a vehicle. It got me from home to the desk and back. That was its job. I never questioned whether it was up for anything more.

I started as a software engineer, founded a few companies, and at one point worked from Portugal for a company based in Los Angeles. That meant starting my day at 6 p.m. and finishing at 3 or 4 a.m. Exercise was not even on the list. Nutrition meant eating whatever was available, whenever I remembered. I built my career on discipline and long hours, but I applied none of that discipline to myself.

## The photo that changed everything

When I joined Powerdot, I felt on top of the world. I gave a presentation to the entire company about technology strategy, and the room was engaged, the energy was real. People took photos. During the talk, I was already thinking about which picture I would post on LinkedIn to share how proud and excited I was.

Then I saw the photos.

I looked at myself and thought: who is this guy? I did not recognize the person in those images. The gap between how I felt inside, proud, sharp, full of energy, and how I looked on the outside was impossible to ignore. That was the moment I knew something had to change.

## Starting from zero

I did what most people do first. I started eating less. Then I started reading about nutrition, calories, deficits, macros. I realized I needed professional help, not guesswork. In September 2024, I met my nutritionist. He is a sports nutritionist and a competitive powerlifter himself. He helped me build a real plan with clear goals and better food choices. But I knew nutrition alone was not enough. The next step was obvious: I needed to go to a gym.

That was entirely outside my comfort zone. I am a father of two. My family schedules are packed from early morning to late at night. Adding gym time to that felt impossible. Where would it fit? Who handles the kids? When do I even start?

Looking back, most of those problems existed only in my head. The real issue was not time or logistics. It was prioritization. I had spent fifteen years prioritizing work above everything else. Rearranging my life to include training felt like a massive change, but it was really a simple shift of mindset.

## The system that made it possible

None of this works without my wife. She is a Lead Product Manager in a technology business, running her own demanding schedule every day. We both operate at full capacity from early morning to late at night. But when I told her I wanted to change, she did not just say "go for it." She supported me, and we planned this together. We treated it like any project. We looked at our nutrition and agreed on what had to change. Less sugar, less oil, more vegetables, more fruit, more water. We redesigned how we eat as a family.

Then we tackled the schedule. Two careers in tech, two kids, zero free time. We split the week. She did not just make space for me. She jumped into the journey herself, on her own days, with her own goals. We are on the same path, running it in parallel. I train Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. She trains Tuesdays and Thursdays. Whoever is not at the gym handles the morning routine at home.

We found a gym that we both liked. Their methodology was exactly what we needed. A personal trainer in every session. A plan designed for each of us. Progression structured in phases: technique first, then repetitions, then strength, then resistance, then back to strength again. They measured body fat, ran bioimpedance tests, and took every piece of planning off our plates. All we had to do was show up and execute.

## The first sparks

In the beginning, everything was hard. I could not run more than 800 meters. I had no technique for a back squat or a bench press. I felt clumsy and out of place. But after a few weeks, I noticed small improvements. I could run a bit farther. I did not feel as tired. Those small sparks of progress kept me going. After a few months, the pieces connected. I went from not being able to run to signing up for a 10-kilometer race. I started at 96 kilograms. Eight months later, I hit 75 kilograms, my lowest weight since high school. I started to see muscles. My body started to take shape.

And something surprising happened. My headaches disappeared.

Since I was young, I always had headaches. I took ibuprofen regularly and treated it as normal, like background noise that never stopped. After months of training, better nutrition, and drinking more water, they were gone. I still do not know which specific change made the difference. Probably all of them together. But I went from constant headaches to none.

## More than exercise

This process became much more than losing weight and getting in shape. It changed how I live. I started reading about longevity, VO2 max, supplements, and how strength training and nutrition affect the probability of serious disease. I started sleeping better. I built a routine and learned that when motivation fades, discipline and cadence carry you forward. Nothing beats showing up every day.

The fitness community surprised me more than anything. I have never been around people so supportive, so humble, so willing to help someone who is just starting. People at the gym shared their own stories, corrected my form without making me feel small, and showed me what real humility looks like, even when they were far stronger and more experienced than me.

## Better person, better professional

Training rewired how I see people. I started valuing those who bring energy, who support your growth, who stay with you when things are hard. I started moving away from people who drain you and give nothing back. I could not have done any of this without my wife, who was all in from day one. Without the nutritionist who pushed me toward the gym. Without the trainers who treated a complete beginner with patience and respect.

This made me a better professional and a better leader. The discipline, the resilience, the ability to push through on hard days, all of it transfers directly to how I lead my team. I learned to talk to myself with strength and courage, to not back down when things get difficult. Fitness taught me that the people with the best results should be the ones supporting those who are just starting or struggling the most.

## Just start

If you are sitting where I was, work-focused, body on autopilot, feeling like your physical self is just along for the ride, I have one thing to say. Go to the gym. Find someone who will guide you. Just start. In eighteen months, I went from looking at a photo and not recognizing myself to someone who sleeps better, thinks with more clarity, leads with more patience, and feels proud of what he sees.

You do not need a perfect plan. You need day one. Invest in yourself. Take care of yourself. Protect yourself. The life you get back is worth every awkward, clumsy, uncomfortable rep. I promisse you: It's worth it.
